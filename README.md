# Example of integration with PureFi

This project demonstrates a basic PureFi use case. It comes with a sample contract, a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Create and fill env file

```shell
cp env.example env.
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai
```
